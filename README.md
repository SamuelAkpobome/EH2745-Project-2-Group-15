# EH2745-Project-2-Group-15
This is the solution to the EH2745 Computer Applications in Power Systems Project 2 work.  We present our program which uses the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to analyze a database from a sample power system then by programming and Machine learning the algorithm is implemented to solve the problem.
